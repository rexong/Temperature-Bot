# Temperature-Bot
This bot helps to key in an acceptable temperature into the webpage, using webscraping from python and the cloud service Heroku.

Using selenium in python, the bot will go to the website, https://temptaking.ado.sg/group/b24b3fa41017a5faab1d2a956962f724, to key in an acceptable temperature twice a day. 
To make this bot enter the temperature remotely, Heroku is used to deploy the code at anytime fromm 8am-9am and 8pm to 9pm.
